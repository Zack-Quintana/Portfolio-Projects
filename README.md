How was working with MongoDB different from working with PostgreSQL?

They both felt pretty similar. Besides small differences with syntax and the like, the only thing that really felt different was having to write a for loop to insert all the values into a dictionary rather than being able to use a function to insert tables.

What was easier, and what was harder?

Because I have less experience with writing a for loop, and because for me the logic to writing it is more difficult to graps than defining a function, it seemed that mongodb was a little harder. Really, both of them - and python in general - seem pretty straight forward. So long as you follow the instructions of the different commands and of the language as a whole you can do whatever you want.
